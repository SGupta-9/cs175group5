### << Insert Proposal Details >>

## Summary:
The focus of our project is path finding. Our goal is to build an agent that can naviage the environtment to find the most efficient path to the reward, or a list of rewards. The agent will process inputs from elements in the environment to evaluate possible options. The output would be the optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal. A possible application is programs for warehouse bots to find and collect items to fullfill a customer's order.
