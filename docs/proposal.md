### << Insert Proposal Details >>

## Summary:
The focus of our project is path finding. Our goal is to build an agent that can naviage the environtment to find the most efficient path to the reward, or a list of rewards. The agent will process inputs from elements in the environment to evaluate possible options. The output would be the optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal. A possible application is programs for warehouse bots to find and collect items to fullfill a customer's order.

## Evaluation
# Quantitative Evaluation
Time would be our most important metric, which we would measure in seconds. 
We would want the agent to find the reward in the shortest time possible. 
Distance is another important metric, which can be measured in blocks or meters.
We can use distance to determine if agent can find the most efficient path to 
the goal. Additionally, we also want to keep track of number of moves taken. 
If possible within the time line of the course, we would want to train the agent
to minimize the number of moves taken throught clearing obstacles in the environment
to reveal shortest path.
